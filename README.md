# Cognifyz-Technologies


This repository contains the solutions to the machine learning tasks completed as part of my **Machine Learning Internship at Cognifyz Technologies**. The main goal is to build data-driven models for restaurant data that perform:

- **Cuisine classification**
- **Rating prediction**
- **Restaurant recommendation**

---


## 🧠 Task 1: Restaurant Rating Prediction

**Objective:**  
To predict restaurant ratings using regression techniques.

**Approach:**
- Feature preprocessing
- Regression model training
- Performance evaluation using regression metrics

---


## 🧠 Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation System

**Objective:**  
To recommend restaurants based on user preferences and restaurant features.

**Approach:**
- Content-based filtering
- Similarity calculation between restaurants
- Generating top recommendations

---


## 🧠 Task 3: Cuisine Classification

**Objective:**  
To classify restaurants based on their cuisine types using machine learning.

**Approach:**
- Data cleaning and handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Train-test split  
- Model: Random Forest Classifier  
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Classification Report
